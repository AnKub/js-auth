# 🧑‍💻 **SASS Project**

A project using **Sass**, **Webpack**, and **Express** to build a server-side application with dynamic styles. It includes the configuration for Sass compilation, Webpack bundling, and Nodemon for live reloading.

---

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used:**
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor for writing clean, scalable, and maintainable styles.
- **Webpack**: Bundles JavaScript, CSS, and other assets for the browser.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the server-side application.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler for converting modern JavaScript into compatible code.
- **ESLint** & **Prettier**: Tools for code quality and formatting.
- **Nodemon**: Watches for changes and restarts the server automatically.

---

### 🔧 **Available Commands:**

#### 🚀 **Development Commands:**
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development environment with live reloading using:
  - Sass watching
  - Webpack watching
  - Nodemon for server-side updates
  
- **`npm run start`**: Starts the production build:
  - Builds Sass and JavaScript assets
  - Runs the server
  
- **`npm run webpack:watch`**: Watches for file changes and rebuilds assets.
- **`npm run webpack:build`**: Builds the Webpack production bundle.
- **`npm run sass:watch`**: Watches Sass files for changes and compiles them to CSS.
- **`npm run sass:build`**: Compiles Sass to CSS for production.
